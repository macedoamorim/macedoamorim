# 🧑🏻‍💻 Pedro Amorim
**`Aspiring backend developer`** 

---

Hi, I'm Pedro Macedo Amorim, a Systems Analysis and Development student at Universidade Nove de Julho (UNINOVE), with a strong interest in back-end development.
I am currently developing my skills in Java, SQL, and Object-Oriented Programming, always focused on writing clean and well-structured code.
I’m seeking an internship opportunity in IT to gain hands-on experience and continue growing as a developer.
